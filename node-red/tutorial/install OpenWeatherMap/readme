This tutorial will show how to include OpenWeatherMap on Node-red

  The dashboard will show weather and humidity from openweathermap.org 
  Using local mqtt to publish and subcribe data. 
  
Have the node-red installed on your device.
1. run node-red
2. install palette for dashboard and Openweathermap 
3. go to openweathermap.org and register to get weather API


On Node-red, set openweathermap with the API you got. For accuracy, use location as coordinates (go to that openweathermap.org
and search for your location, the take the coordinates from there and paste in node) 

Then connect everything as normal or you can see the connection in picture from the "install OpenWeatherMap" folder.
