trigger a flow whenever Node-RED starts.
This could be used to initialise context variables, or to send a notification that Node-RED has been restarted.
Use an Inject node configured to fire once on start.
When configured to fire on start, the "Inject" node will be automatically triggered a few hundred milliseconds after it is deployed. This delay is used to help ensure the rest of the flows have been created and Started by this point.
