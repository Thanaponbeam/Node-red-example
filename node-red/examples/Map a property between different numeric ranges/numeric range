scale a number from one numeric range to another. For example, a sensor reading in the range 0 - 1023 should be mapped to a voltage range of 0 - 5.
Use the Range node to map between the defined ranges.
The "Range" node can be used to linearly scale between two different numberic ranges.
By default, the result is not constrained to the range defined in the node. This means using the voltage example above, a value of 2046 would map to a result of 10.
